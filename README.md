# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping earthquake's GeoJSON data using Mapbox API, Leaflet, and D3.js 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days, we will plot the data to a map.
